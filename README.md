# Drawer

Drawer can used to show content with more intiutive way with sliding left/right. It is more user frendly that modal dialog box. Points below explain why.

1. There is higher chances of feeling bound cause it is not completely different interface. 

2. User can take reference from available content even interact with unless it enforces page refresh. 

3. Drawer is more mobile friendly than modal. In modal, we have to look for cross icon somewhere in top right. Drawer can be simply closed with slide gestures. If drawer comes from right, swipe right, more intuitive than modal close icon.
